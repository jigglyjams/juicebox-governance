## Synopsis

To renew the recurring payout and reserved token beneficiary for zhape.eth, and to increase the payout from $1,500 /FC to $2,000 / FC.

## Motivation

To go on contributing to JuiceboxDAO in community communication, visibility and translation, etc.

## Specification

Pay zhape.eth US$2,000 in equivalent of ETH each Funding Cycle, for 7 FCs.

## Rationale

### What I’ve done during this payout period：

- I kept on compiling the Town Hall summaries every week. I have been trying to improve the contents along the way, by adding more context such as relevant images, discussion links, etc. so as to hopefully make it easier for folks to see the full picture. What I have done in this period:

- And also the Chinese versions of Town hall summaries, I tried to do it in a way more of storytelling than simple translation of English versions, after making sure I personally had digested those info properly.  The summaries can be found here (I keep them in one location for purpose of back checking by members): [https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/935431085561630721/978201195774619668](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/935431085561630721/978201195774619668)

- As I planned in my last renewal proposal, all the blogposts translated in the last couple of months have been proofread and synchronized to [https://info.juicebox.money/zh/blog/](https://info.juicebox.money/zh/blog/).  I haven’t touched on translations of docs and history proposal, as many of them are either outdated, changed or not as useful.

       And here is the link to my proofreading jobs where people can find the original translations and those of my proofreading. Any questions, corrections or even challenge will be warmly welcome.

- Acted as a moderator in the CN channels, helped answering questions from our Chinese speaking fellow members, shared our building progress with them in a timely manner, etc.

- I have been working on Crowdin to translate our website into Chinese, with the kind help of @twodam being the proofreader.  I have been trying to keep the translated rate at at least 95% or higher at this interval.

- I began to experiment with my Twitter account ([https://twitter.com/zhape1112](https://twitter.com/zhape1112)) to build some kind of outlet for Chinese contents about JuiceboxDAO:

	- to keep members posted of different stages of new proposals voting stages(temp check and Snapshot voting) every funding cycle, and provide short summaries to these proposals, hopefully to help boosting community involvement;

	- to help broadcasting some other activities of the DAO, e.g. the Audit Fund project NFT minting and JBX airdrop, so that CN members can choose to join if they wish.

	- to experiment sharing of our blogposts Chinese translations, by make a hashtag #Juicebox博客分享（#Juicebox blogs sharing）

	- to experiment the sharing of new projects on Juicebox by hashtag of #Juiceboxprojectssharing, explain what those project configurations can affect the potential contributors in an objective as possible way. No shilling.

### What I am going to do：

Basically I will keep on doing what I am doing right now, probably add or reduce some workload depending on the development of things.

- Keep compiling Town Hall summaries, trying to improve it along the way. Sincerely hoping to get some feedback from people, esp. in the English version. 

- Be a responsible mod to the CN channels.

- Keep working on Crowdin for the translation of our website.

- If the DAO approves, I want to translate the rest of our blog posts in chronological order, and share them out on Twitter, or on some other website like Medium, Substack or Mirror by setting up a dedicated account for Chinese contents.

- Keep sharing Juicebox related information in Chinese with my Twitter, though I don’t have too many followers, but some of the content can reach quite deep into our ecosystem with the retweets by our official account. 

- Any other work beneficiary to JuiceboxDAO.

## Risks

I am not as responsible for my job, or I fail to deliver what I promised.

## Timeline

If approved, this proposal will take effect from FC #35, and end on FC#41.

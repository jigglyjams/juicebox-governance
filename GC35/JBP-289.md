## Synopsis

Renew and increase the recurring payout to filipv from 6,000 USD/FC → 6,500 USD/FC.

## Recent Work

(WIP, not exhaustive)

### Subgraph

- [Implemented AddToBalance events](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-subgraph/commit/ed0fd01cb3c4b3fc964d815d6111b80def1487bd) into the Subgraph for all protocol versions.

- [Implemented funding cycle](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-subgraph/pull/20) `Configure` and `Init` events for all protocol versions (review pending). This will allow users to see queued reconfigurations and updated funding cycles in project activity feeds and other services. Ported all metadata unpacking libraries to AssemblyScript to allow funding cycle metadata to be viewed directly on the subgraph.

### Frontend

- [Implemented AddToBalance events](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/2176) into the project event feed.

- Created [juice-rss](https://github.com/filipvvv/juice-rss), an RSS notification service for Juicebox Projects. A live instance is available at [https://juice-rss.deno.dev](https://juice-rss.deno.dev). RSS is a popular notification service which can be used with IFTTT, Zapier, and other services to generate email notifications, Discord messages, or other integrations.

### Documentation

- Ongoing technical maintainence of the [juice-docs](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs). This includes building the [new home page](https://info.juicebox.money/), implementing Algolia DocSearch, fixing bugs, package maintainence, and more.

- Documenting NFT Rewards. This is a work in progress, and will be a focus for the next week or two. Current work is live on [https://info.juicebox.money](https://info.juicebox.money).

- Creating guides and tutorials, including:

	- [**Launch a Custom Ethereum Treasury With Juicebox (CONFIGURATION GUIDE)**](https://youtu.be/kWxaFn4iwug) (~500 views).

	- [**Juicebox: Make an Ethereum Treasury and a Token in 5 Minutes**](https://youtu.be/pJszOKMxYNE) (~300 views)

	- Configuration guide at [https://info.juicebox.money/user](https://info.juicebox.money/user)

	- Guides for [Snapshot](https://info.juicebox.money/user/governance/snapshot), [Gnosis Safe](https://info.juicebox.money/user/governance/gnosis), and [Discord](https://info.juicebox.money/user/community/discord/dao/).

### Community Alignment

- Discord server management.

- Webhook service for Discord announcements. Used for the first time yesterday.

- “Community management” work. Answering questions, responding to inquiries, etc.

- Running town halls in collaboration with @nicholas. Recordings, agendas, etc.

- Maintaining Notion, including the proposals database (Notion janitor).

- Maintaining DAO YouTube channel.

### Bookkeeping

- [juice-accountant](https://github.com/filipvvv/juice-accountant) automatically generates accounting CSVs for a [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money/)
 project: it retreives and processes token holders, payments, redemptions, and distributions, then generates CSV files with fiat conversions in the currency of your choice. This is helpful for any project creator that wants to do accounting or pay taxes.

- [juice-fees](https://github.com/filipvvv/juice-fees) generates accounting CSVs for fees paid by every Juicebox project, with fiat conversions in the currency of your choice.

- [safe-refunds](https://github.com/filipvvv/safe-refunds) generates a CSV of a Gnosis Safe's executed transactions, executors, and gas fees. This was created for calculating gas refunds for the Juicebox multisig, but can be used by any project creator (or anybody else) using a Gnosis Safe.

- [Various accounting/bookkeeping work](https://github.com/filipvvv/juice-accounting) including a balance sheet and several other documents.

### Miscellaneous

- Various governance work, including an amendment for this funding cycle. Governance should be pretty stable at this point. Authored 51 proposals to date. Can hopefully taper this off over time as well.

- Multisig work. Updating membership, queuing/verifying transactions, and other operations. @twodam does most of this.

- Explored various fiat options. Not quite at fruition yet.

- Helped several project creators. Discords, project configurations, marketing strategy, put them in touch with lawyers, etc.

- Resolving various Etherscan verification issues.

- Represented the DAO by speaking on several podcasts and events, including:

	- [**The Flexible Way to Fundraise for Your Next Web3 Project | Filip from Juicebox**](https://podcasts.apple.com/sk/podcast/the-flexible-way-to-fundraise-for-your-next-web3/id1614643326?i=1000581786444)

	- [**DAO News Report: July 20, 2022 – featuring Filip from Juicebox**](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dao-news-report-july-20-2022-featuring-filip-from-juicebox/id1630815761?i=1000570565500)

	- **Internet of People Podcast (being released in December)**

	- DAOPlanet NYC

	- Several Twitter spaces

- Good deal of work on this [legal tool](https://daolabs-docs.on.fleek.co/legal/intro/start.md) for Juicebox projects. Not done yet. The intro section is good though, I will move it to the project creator docs. Pretty insane time committment on this one.

- Work on [DAO Terms of Service](https://info.juicebox.money/tos).

## Upcoming Priorities

- Finish documenting NFT rewards.

- Learn Dune.

- Project configure and init in frontend.

- Get fiat payments working for JBM.

- Better notification services.

- Upgrade project search (and maybe indexing).

- Continue other projects above.

- Start closing down Notion.

- Revamp project creator docs. Wiki style.

- Focus on project creator tooling and distribution.

Also potentially interested in onboarding experience on juicebox.money—looking at [Metamask onboarding library](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/onboarding-library.html).

## Specification

Increase the distribution from the DAO’s v2 treasury to filipv from 6,000 USD/FC to 6,500 USD/FC.

## Risks

The funds might be better utilized elsewhere.

## Timeline

Update this payout in the first funding cycle after this proposal is ratified on Snapshot. Remove this payout in FC#42.

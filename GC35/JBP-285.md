## Motivation

The Governance Process currently has some ambiguities. Although these ambiguities have not yet led to any conflict, our Governance Process should accurately reflect our day-to-day practices to avoid potential controversies.

## Specification

- Ratify this governance process: [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmWkf5yW2gmhbdZoXTLxTDvMJNMFqBT5A8rD19EvVnjhyr](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmWkf5yW2gmhbdZoXTLxTDvMJNMFqBT5A8rD19EvVnjhyr)

- Update Governance Process at [https://info.juicebox.money/dao/process](https://info.juicebox.money/dao/process)

- Update other documentation accordingly.

- Follow the updated governance process.

## Rationale

- More recent proposals should take precedence as they are more likely to accurately represent the DAO’s present wishes.

- Proposals which receive more affirmative votes should take precedence over proposals with lower engagement, as they are more likely to represent the wishes of the DAO.

- The effective date of proposals should be clear to give executors confidence and prevent any misinterpretations.

## Risks

A controversial proposal with high engagement might take precedence over a less controversial proposal with lower engagement if they conflict and are approved in the same funding cycle.

## Timeline

The updated governance process should take effect upon this proposal’s Snapshot approval.

## Synopsis

Renew Peel’s recurring payout at US$60,000 per funding cycle (FC). Peel is the team that builds and maintains juicebox.money.

## Motivation

[juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) continues to be Juicebox’s gold-standard frontend. And Peel is the team behind it.

**Some highlights since our last payout renewal:**

- Implemented a mainnet-ready NFT Rewards (including subgraph support).

- Shipped ground-up rework of the project creation experience.

- Shipped a frontend for Juicebox V3, backwards-compatible with Juicebox V2 and V1 (including subgraph support).

- Shipped a Safe UI to improve the multisig signer experience.

- Implemented a V3 upgrade path for V2 projects (behind a feature flag, pending general availability).

- Zero-to-one SEO improvements (proper link unfurling for projects, Google indexes projects, etc.).

- Experimental projects like [juice-pay](https://twitter.com/aeolianeth/status/1566619754340970496).

- A ton of smaller features, improvements and bug fixes.

**Next up:**

- **Lovable project discovery**: in an effort to increase payments, we want to get people contributing to more projects on JB. This means improved project searching, improved project share-ability, and more. User activity feeds, bookmarking and notifications are also on the cards.

- **Over-optimize on mobile:** many people visit the site on their phone. Let’s make sure this is optimal. 

- **Improve project owner experience:** continued improvements to project creation, plus additional tools for project owners (for example, analytics, permissions).

- **Multi-token funding.** Fund your Juicebox treasury with USDC, DAI, ETH, and more ([GitHub](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues/1438)). This continues to be on the horizon but will be prioritized with contract crew.

Peel commits to owning and maintaining the following projects:

- [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) and [goerli.juicebox.money.](http://goerli.juicebox.money)

- [The Juicebox Subgraph](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-subgraph), on TheGraph.

- [juice-hooks](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-hooks) - a React Hooks library for the Juicebox V2 protocol.

- [juice-sdk](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-sdk) - a Javascript SDK for the Juicebox V2 protocol.

Other future Juicebox-related projects that require Peel’s involvement should be considered in a separate payout proposal.

## Specification

Continue payouts of  US$60,000 per FC to Peel (V1 project handle `@peel`).

## Rationale

A US$60,000 payout is unchanged from our last proposal. Here is a breakdown of how we are currently using these funds.

> FTE = Full-time equivalent; IC = individual contributor; DRI = directly responsible individual

Our current capacity is as follows (see [Juicebox funding distribution](https://www.juicebox.money/p/peel)):

- 1 lead/DRI @ $14,000 per FC

- 5 FTE ICs @ $9000 per FC

Beyond this, Peel must budget for infrastructure including but not limited to Infura, Vercel, TheGraph, Pinata, and Fathom Analytics.

## Risks

- Peel doesn’t use funds effectively.

- Peel’s projects don’t meet community expectations.

## Timeline

This proposal should take effect in FC 35.

Peel should be removed from recurring payouts from FC 42 (after six cycles), unless superseded by another proposal.

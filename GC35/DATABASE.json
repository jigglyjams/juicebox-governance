I have been trying to improve the contents along the way, by adding more context such as relevant images, discussion links, etc. so as to hopefully make it easier for folks to see the full picture.

The summaries can be found here (I keep them in one location for purpose of back checking by members): [https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/935431085561630721/978201195774619668](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/935431085561630721/978201195774619668)\n\n- As I planned in my last renewal proposal, all the blogposts translated in the last couple of months have been proofread and synchronized to [https://info.juicebox.money/zh/blog/](https://info.juicebox.money/zh/blog/).

I have been trying to keep the translated rate at at least 95% or higher at this interval.\n\n- I began to experiment with my Twitter account ([https://twitter.com/zhape1112](https://twitter.com/zhape1112)) to build some kind of outlet for Chinese contents about JuiceboxDAO:\n\n\t- to keep members posted of different stages of new proposals voting stages(temp check and Snapshot voting) every funding cycle, and provide short summaries to these proposals, hopefully to help boosting community involvement;\n\n\t- to help broadcasting some other activities of the DAO, e.g. the Audit Fund project NFT minting and JBX airdrop, so that CN members can choose to join if they wish.\n\n\t- to experiment sharing of our blogposts Chinese translations, by make a hashtag #Juicebox博客分享（#Juicebox blogs sharing）\n\n\t- to experiment the sharing of new projects on Juicebox by hashtag of #Juiceboxprojectssharing, explain what those project configurations can affect the potential contributors in an objective as possible way. No shilling.\n\n### What I am going to do：\n\nBasically I will keep on doing what I am doing right now, probably add or reduce some workload depending on the development of things.\n\n- Keep compiling Town Hall summaries, trying to improve it along the way. Sincerely hoping to get some feedback from people, esp. in the English version. \n\n- Be a responsible mod to the CN channels.\n\n- Keep working on Crowdin for the translation of our website.\n\n- If the DAO approves, I want to translate the rest of our blog posts in chronological order, and share them out on Twitter, or on some other website like Medium, Substack or Mirror by setting up a dedicated account for Chinese contents.\n\n- Keep sharing Juicebox related information in Chinese with my Twitter, though I don’t have too many followers, but some of the content can reach quite deep into our ecosystem with the retweets by our official account. \n\n- Any other work beneficiary to JuiceboxDAO.\n\n## Risks\n\nI am not as responsible for my job, or I fail to deliver what I promised.\n\n## Timeline\n\nIf approved, this proposal will take effect from FC #35, and end on FC#41. \n"

Peel is the team that builds and maintains juicebox.money.\n\n## Motivation\n\n[juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) continues to be Juicebox’s gold-standard frontend. And Peel is the team behind it.\n\n**Some highlights since our last payout renewal:**\n\n- Implemented a mainnet-ready NFT Rewards (including subgraph support).\n\n- Shipped ground-up rework of the project creation experience.\n\n- Shipped a frontend for Juicebox V3, backwards-compatible with Juicebox V2 and V1 (including subgraph support).\n\n- Shipped a Safe UI to improve the multisig signer experience.\n\n- Implemented a V3 upgrade path for V2 projects (behind a feature flag, pending general availability).\n\n- Zero-to-one SEO improvements (proper link unfurling for projects, Google indexes projects, etc.).\n\n- Experimental projects like [juice-pay](https://twitter.com/aeolianeth/status/1566619754340970496).\n\n- A ton of smaller features, improvements and bug fixes.\n\n**Next up:**\n\n- **Lovable project discovery**: in an effort to increase payments, we want to get people contributing to more projects on JB. This means improved project searching, improved project share-ability, and more. User activity feeds, bookmarking and notifications are also on the cards.\n\n- **Over-optimize on mobile:** many people visit the site on their phone. Let’s make sure this is optimal. \n\n- **Improve project owner experience:** continued improvements to project creation, plus additional tools for project owners (for example, analytics, permissions).\n\n- **Multi-token funding.** Fund your Juicebox treasury with USDC, DAI, ETH, and more ([GitHub](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues/1438)). This continues to be on the horizon but will be prioritized with contract crew.\n\nPeel commits to owning and maintaining the following projects:\n\n- [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) and [goerli.juicebox.money.](http://goerli.juicebox.money)\n\n- [The Juicebox Subgraph](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-subgraph), on TheGraph.\n\n- [juice-hooks](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-hooks) - a React Hooks library for the Juicebox V2 protocol.\n\n- [juice-sdk](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-sdk) - a Javascript SDK for the Juicebox V2 protocol.\n\nOther future Juicebox-related projects that require Peel’s involvement should be considered in a separate payout proposal.\n\n## Specification\n\nContinue payouts of  US$60,000 per FC to Peel (V1 project handle `@peel`).\n\n## Rationale\n\nA US$60,000 payout is unchanged from our last proposal. Here is a breakdown of how we are currently using these funds.\n\n> FTE = Full-time equivalent; IC = individual contributor; DRI = directly responsible individual\n\nOur current capacity is as follows (see [Juicebox funding distribution](https://www.juicebox.money/p/peel)):\n\n- 1 lead/DRI @ $14,000 per FC\n\n- 5 FTE ICs @ $9000 per FC\n\nBeyond this, Peel must budget for infrastructure including but not limited to Infura, Vercel, TheGraph, Pinata, and Fathom Analytics.\n\n---\n\nRelevant links:\n\n- Peel proposals: [https://github.com/peeldao/proposals/tree/main/proposals](https://github.com/peeldao/proposals/tree/main/proposals)\n\n- Peel ‘Proposals’ Discord channel: [https://discord.com/channels/939317843059679252/940041243491201055](https://discord.com/channels/939317843059679252/940041243491201055)\n\n## Risks\n\n- Peel doesn’t use funds effectively.\n\n- Peel’s projects don’t meet community expectations.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal should take effect in FC 35.\n\nPeel should be removed from recurring payouts from FC 42 (after six cycles), unless superseded by another proposal.\n"

Contributors which would have otherwise stewarded such a process are no longer active Juicebox contributors. Juicebox should aim to resolve any outstanding governance proposals.\n\n## Specification\n\n- Multisig to unwrap 1,205.31527829 wETH in exchange for ETH.\n\n- Multisig to add the resulting ETH to the balance of the JuiceboxDAO v1 treasury.\n\n- Revoke the entirety of JBP-186 - Launch Treasury Management.\n\n## Rationale\n\nJuiceboxDAO’s v2 and forthcoming v3 treasury do not have the balances necessary to support redemption (and as such have redemption disabled). Until a v1 -> v2/3 token migration can take place, the DAO should concentrate the majority of its ETH in its v1 treasury to support redemption.\n\n## Risks\n\nRevoking this proposal leaves the DAO with no clear plan for treasury management, which leaves the DAO with high exposure to ETH (and its volatility).\n\n## Timeline\n\nEffective upon this proposal’s passing. To be executed within the following 30 days.\n"

Thirsty Thirsty’s [Tier 1 Membership NFT](https://thirstythirsty-nft.herokuapp.com/) costs 0.4 ETH, meaning the DAO purchased **19 memberships**—none of which have been distributed.\n\nEach membership comes with:\n\n- 1 bottle of Collector Pinot Noir EXCLUSIVE to Thirsty Thirsty, made by Phelan Farm (Rajat Parr) + NFT art by Marleigh Culver as the wine label.\n\n- Launch Party access to Thirsty Thirsty’s NFT NYC lunch.\n\n- VIP Winery access.\n\n- Digital workshops and healings.\n\n- Future TT event access/member benefits for NFT holders.\n\n- Fine art NFT by Marleigh Culver.\n\n- VIP dining access at top restaurants.\n\n- VIP Private Chef access.\n\n- First access to TT travel experiences (ex: Harvest Experience, Ceremony in Amazonas).\n\n## Specification\n\nOne membership NFT each to:\n\n- Sage\n\n- Zom\n\n- Felixander\n\n- Jigglyjams\n\n- Burtula\n\n- 0xSTVG\n\n- Kenbot\n\n- Rakelle\n\n- filipv\n\n- …\n\nAny remaining memberships should be distributed to the DAO multisig for future use.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe DAO should roughly prioritize:\n\n- Contributors who could not come to DevCon.\n\n- Community members who could not come to DevCon.\n\n- Contributors who went to DevCon.\n\n- Community members who went to DevCon.\n\n- Random anons.\n\n## Risks\n\nThese memberships might be more effectively utilized in the future or in a different way (e.g. prizes in a competition, donated to charity, and so on).\n\n## Timeline\n\nIf possible: to be distributed once Thirsty Thirsty has Juicebox NFT rewards.\n\nOtherwise, to be distributed within 90 days of this proposal’s Snapshot ratification.\n"

The swap one is almost done tested, the bridge should be fairly easy to implement\n\n\t- Juicebox on L2: When NFTReward/Defifa are shipped (which is now-ish), this will free some more time to deploy “somewhere else”\n\n\t- find bugs - always, then smash them - hard\n\n\t- Other project (mostly extensions) are listed in my todo (which I’m updating sometimes, kinda): [https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/786985806396784690/974974959560585256](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/786985806396784690/974974959560585256)\n\n## Specification\n\nContinue the current scheme wihle modifying the recipient address: send 18500$ worth of ETH to the address resolved by exhausted-pigeon.eth (the parent company of DrGorilla.eth), each FC, for a total of 6FC, from the V2 treasury.\n\n<u>Upgradibility</u>: The target address might be updated to an allocator during this proposal’s life.\n\nTo avoid burdening the dao with a new vote to change the address, I suggest the following process, part of this proposal: “_DrGorilla.eth will transmit the new address in the multisig channel, for inclusion in the next funding cycle reconfiguration. This will be sent as a message signed by the DrGorilla.eth address private key. Upon verification of this signed message, the beneficiary addresses of DrGorilla in the payout group 1 (ETH payout) will be updated - the reserved address remains unchanged_”.\n\n## Rationale\n\n<u>Why keeping the ape?</u>\nI have been an active contributor in Juicebox for more than a year.\n\nI have been involved in designing and testing V2 and V3 as well as plenty of extensions, answering 2 audits, finding new bugs, addressing them,  developing new functionalities, processing code4arena contests, etc. I am at ease in Juicebox ecosystem code and mechanisms, which is much needed to safely ship additional features and to challenge the status quo when (imo) needed (including the bitmap mechanism in NFTReward, for a potentially huge gas saving, or the cloning pattern to avoid increasing the gas burden on users minting NFT). \n\n<u>Why keeping the payout unchanged?</u>\nAfter an informal contributor poll and a quick research (data easily available on Twitter, other DAO’s forums, Google), this salary is expected for a contract engineer with a similar experience level (I coded part of the NFTRewardDeployer in bytecode [https://github.com/drgorillamd/clone-deployed-contract](https://github.com/drgorillamd/clone-deployed-contract)).\nI’ve met previous objectives and have a set of updated ones of similar complexity.\n\n## Risks\n\nDrGorilla might disappear, stop producing quality code (potentially leading to a loss of treasury fund) or just start being an overall jerk.\n\n## Timeline\n\nImmediate effect\n\nProof of ownership: \nDrGorilla.eth current address signing the message (without “ ”): “exhausted-pigeon.eth”\n\n{\n\"address\": \"0x6860f1a0cf179ed93abd3739c7f6c8961a4eea3c\",\n\"msg\": \"0x6578686175737465642d706967656f6e2e657468\",\n\"sig\": \"7ca1922689acb24bbce0c7648db83b6d64d22081b2743e558572768cfbafbcd900475b0f97de69d7b469ebdf9dae89c2980a52408326bc41956cc01ee3f8e0fa01\",\n\"version\": \"3\",\n\"signer\": \"MEW\"\n}\n"

As Forming matures as a presence in the metaverse, it has become clear more resources are needed to run a cohesive and consistent program. This proposal would insure the proper funds to payout the LD production crew to continue running the FORMING program as well as continuing to pay out the selected monthly artists. This would entice more artists, musicians and web3 communities to directly interact with Juicebox through Forming. We will continue to experiment with NFT rewards and other Juicebox features to further show how Juicebox can be used to manage any creative project. Creating content and tutorials that relate more directly to musicians and artists interested in web3 to make Forming, thus making Juicebox a platform for the “underground” of NFTs.\n\n## Specification\n\n$8350 USD into the Lexicon Devils Juicebox every two weeks for the next 6 FC’s\n\nPer FC budget:\n- $1750 to Forming\n- $6600 to Lexicon Devils Production Crew\n\n## Rationale\n\nHaving a dedicated fund going towards the arts, sponsoring cultural events strengthens the ties between artists & engineers, deepening the creative talent pool of not only the Juicebox ecosystem but Ethereum at large. Juicebox is a prime example of a DAO who sets the cultural tone, in touch with the current zeitgeist of crypto & DAOs. It’s a natural next step for the Lexicon Devils & Juicebox partnership to continue leading the scene in making creative spaces online for artists & engineers, a cultural scheilling point for a new era of the internet.\n\n## Risks\n\nLexicon Devils and FORMING audience fail to understand or adopt JBX. Bear market fud too dominant and crypto skepticism too great creating an uphill battle making expanding our outreach almost impossible. This would result in failure to provide impactful marketing creating greater Juicebox awareness, small turn outs, lackluster experiences, and minimal actual benefit to Juicebox protocol.\n\n## Timeline\n\nAs soon as snapshot passes.\n"

This will allow users to see queued reconfigurations and updated funding cycles in project activity feeds and other services. Ported all metadata unpacking libraries to AssemblyScript to allow funding cycle metadata to be viewed directly on the subgraph.\n\n### Frontend\n\n- [Implemented AddToBalance events](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/2176) into the project event feed.\n\n- Created [juice-rss](https://github.com/filipvvv/juice-rss), an RSS notification service for Juicebox Projects. A live instance is available at [https://juice-rss.deno.dev](https://juice-rss.deno.dev). RSS is a popular notification service which can be used with IFTTT, Zapier, and other services to generate email notifications, Discord messages, or other integrations.\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Ongoing technical maintainence of the [juice-docs](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs). This includes building the [new home page](https://info.juicebox.money/), implementing Algolia DocSearch, fixing bugs, package maintainence, and more.\n\n- Documenting NFT Rewards. This is a work in progress, and will be a focus for the next week or two. Current work is live on [https://info.juicebox.money](https://info.juicebox.money).\n\n- Creating guides and tutorials, including:\n\n\t- [**Launch a Custom Ethereum Treasury With Juicebox (CONFIGURATION GUIDE)**](https://youtu.be/kWxaFn4iwug) (~500 views).\n\n\t- [**Juicebox: Make an Ethereum Treasury and a Token in 5 Minutes**](https://youtu.be/pJszOKMxYNE) (~300 views)\n\n\t- Configuration guide at [https://info.juicebox.money/user](https://info.juicebox.money/user)\n\n\t- Guides for [Snapshot](https://info.juicebox.money/user/governance/snapshot), [Gnosis Safe](https://info.juicebox.money/user/governance/gnosis), and [Discord](https://info.juicebox.money/user/community/discord/dao/).\n\n### Community Alignment\n\n- Discord server management.\n\n- Webhook service for Discord announcements. Used for the first time yesterday.\n\n- “Community management” work. Answering questions, responding to inquiries, etc.\n\n- Running town halls in collaboration with @nicholas. Recordings, agendas, etc.\n\n- Maintaining Notion, including the proposals database (Notion janitor).\n\n- Maintaining DAO YouTube channel.\n\n### Bookkeeping\n\n- [juice-accountant](https://github.com/filipvvv/juice-accountant) automatically generates accounting CSVs for a [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money/)\n project: it retreives and processes token holders, payments, redemptions, and distributions, then generates CSV files with fiat conversions in the currency of your choice. This is helpful for any project creator that wants to do accounting or pay taxes.\n\n- [juice-fees](https://github.com/filipvvv/juice-fees) generates accounting CSVs for fees paid by every Juicebox project, with fiat conversions in the currency of your choice.\n\n- [safe-refunds](https://github.com/filipvvv/safe-refunds) generates a CSV of a Gnosis Safe's executed transactions, executors, and gas fees. This was created for calculating gas refunds for the Juicebox multisig, but can be used by any project creator (or anybody else) using a Gnosis Safe.\n\n- [Various accounting/bookkeeping work](https://github.com/filipvvv/juice-accounting) including a balance sheet and several other documents.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- Various governance work, including an amendment for this funding cycle. Governance should be pretty stable at this point. Authored 51 proposals to date. Can hopefully taper this off over time as well.\n\n- Multisig work. Updating membership, queuing/verifying transactions, and other operations. @twodam does most of this.\n\n- Explored various fiat options. Not quite at fruition yet.\n\n- Helped several project creators. Discords, project configurations, marketing strategy, put them in touch with lawyers, etc.\n\n- Resolving various Etherscan verification issues.\n\n- Represented the DAO by speaking on several podcasts and events, including:\n\n\t- [**The Flexible Way to Fundraise for Your Next Web3 Project | Filip from Juicebox**](https://podcasts.apple.com/sk/podcast/the-flexible-way-to-fundraise-for-your-next-web3/id1614643326?i=1000581786444)\n\n\t- [**DAO News Report: July 20, 2022 – featuring Filip from Juicebox**](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dao-news-report-july-20-2022-featuring-filip-from-juicebox/id1630815761?i=1000570565500)\n\n\t- **Internet of People Podcast (being released in December)**\n\n\t- DAOPlanet NYC\n\n\t- Several Twitter spaces\n\n- Good deal of work on this [legal tool](https://daolabs-docs.on.fleek.co/legal/intro/start.md) for Juicebox projects. Not done yet. The intro section is good though, I will move it to the project creator docs. Pretty insane time committment on this one.\n\n- Work on [DAO Terms of Service](https://info.juicebox.money/tos).\n\n## Upcoming Priorities\n\n- Finish documenting NFT rewards.\n\n- Learn Dune.\n\n- Project configure and init in frontend.\n\n- Get fiat payments working for JBM.\n\n- Better notification services.\n\n- Upgrade project search (and maybe indexing).\n\n- Continue other projects above.\n\n- Start closing down Notion.\n\n- Revamp project creator docs. Wiki style.\n\n- Focus on project creator tooling and distribution.\n\nAlso potentially interested in onboarding experience on juicebox.money—looking at [Metamask onboarding library](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/onboarding-library.html).\n\n## Specification\n\nIncrease the distribution from the DAO’s v2 treasury to filipv from 6,000 USD/FC to 6,500 USD/FC.\n\n## Risks\n\nThe funds might be better utilized elsewhere.\n\n## Timeline\n\nUpdate this payout in the first funding cycle after this proposal is ratified on Snapshot. Remove this payout in FC#42.\n"

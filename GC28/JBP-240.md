## Thesis

Renew Peel’s recurring payout at US$60,000 per funding cycle (FC). Peel is the team that builds and maintains juicebox.money.

## Motivation

The Juicebox protocol needs a gold-standard frontend.

Other Juicebox frontends will come and go. But for the Juicebox protocol to continue to grow, there must be one frontend that stands the test of time.

Such a frontend must be built with security, longevity, and usability in mind. It must be built with (very) tight collaboration with the Juicebox contract crew. And it must balance new features with the need to support all past Juicebox projects.

[juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) is Juicebox’s gold-standard frontend.

And Peel is the team behind it.

Peel is delivering. We are a team of six engineers and two UX designers on the grind to keep the juice flowing.

Some highlights since our last payout renewal:

- Shipped a frontend for Juicebox V2, backwards-compatible with Juicebox V1.

- Overhauled our infrastructure to address critical security, reliability, performance and SEO issues. Our underlying tech stack is now NextJS, running on Vercel.

- Launched NFT Rewards and JBX staking (veBanny) on Rinkeby test net.

- Built a V2 upgrade path for V1 project token holders (behind a feature flag, pending general availability).

- Added a variety of user-requested features including Payable Address deployments, payment memo stickers, and a juicier home page (featured on [Bankless](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/crypto-treasury-management-juicebox)).

But we are not done. Here’s what’s on our horizon:

- **Multi-token funding.** Fund your Juicebox treasury with USDC, DAI, ETH, and more ([GitHub](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues/1438)).

- **Usability overhaul.** We want to create the best possible experience for Juicebox project owners. This means a seamless project creation experience, intuitive project management tools and settings, and improving owner confidence when submitting transactions ([1](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues/1390), [2](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues/1327)).

- **Better distribution.** We're solving long-awaited social media and SEO issues related to juicebox.money. Better link unfurling and juicier Google results coming soon ([GitHub](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/1555)).

- **Robust versioning UX.** The Juicebox protocol contracts are always evolving with bug fixes and security patches. We must devise a contract versioning support strategy for the frontend ([GitHub](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues/1440)).

Peel commits to owning and maintaining the following projects:

- [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) and [rinkeby.juicebox.money](http://rinkeby.juicebox.money) (or a future preferred testnet).

- [The Juicebox Subgraph](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-subgraph), on TheGraph.

- [juice-hooks](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-hooks) - a React Hooks library for the Juicebox V2 protocol.

- [juice-sdk](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-sdk) - a Javascript SDK for the Juicebox V2 protocol.

## Specification

Continue payouts of  US$60,000 per FC to Peel (V1 project handle `@peel`).

## Rationale

A US$60,000 payout represents an additional $14,000 per funding cycle.

> FTE = Full-time equivalent; IC = individual contributor; DRI = directly responsible individual

Our current capacity is as follows (see [Juicebox funding distribution](https://www.juicebox.money/p/peel)):

- 1 lead/DRI @ $14,000 per FC

- 3.4 FTE ICs @ $9000 per FC

We are requesting more budget to scale to the following:

- 1 lead/DRI @ $14,000 per FC

- 5 FTE ICs @ $9000 per FC

This enables us to:

- Scale up our UX efforts to 1 FTE (currently, we have no one focused on UX).

- Scale up our engineering team from 3.4 FTE to 4 (to account for existing contributors increasing their responsibilities)

Our development team has scaled sufficiently. We won’t be expanding our recurring contributor base in the foreseeable future.

Beyond this, Peel must budget for infrastructure including Infura, Blocknative, Vercel, TheGraph, Pinata, and Fathom Analytics.

## Risks

- Peel doesn’t use funds effectively.

- Peel’s projects don’t live up to expectations.

## Timeline

This proposal should take effect in FC 28.

Peel should be removed from recurring payouts from FC 35 (after six cycles), unless superseded by another proposal.

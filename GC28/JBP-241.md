## Thesis

Grant 50,000 $JBX from dao.jbx.eth multisig to each team that submitted a project to the Buidl Guild hackathon.

## Motivation

This proposal’s intent is to reward participants for building in the Juicebox ecosystem. A small JBX grant to each team will diversify governance power and increases these active builders’ sense of belonging in the JBDAO community. 

To be eligible for the JBX grant, teams will have to fill out the feedback form. Teams that do not fill out the form will not be eligible for the distribution.

By measuring the grant recipient’s participation in future votes, we will also be able to test whether hackathon participation is a meaningful qualifier for receiving JBX grants in future. This will be relevant information if we run more hackathons in future.

## Specification

- Create a feedback form for hackathon participants (already [started here](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/998740758037286932/998989074662699148) in Discord) 

- Teams that complete the form (at least one member) by the end of FC#27 will be eligible for the 50k JBX airdrop.

- Multisig distributes 50k JBX to all projects that have fulfilled the above criterion at the start of FC#28. @Zom_bae and @nicholas will keep track of who has filled out the form and will communicate this information to the multisig in advance of the distribution date.

- Nine teams participated; max distribution is 450K $JBX

## Risks

- We could mess up the distribution transaction

- Participants could insta-liquidate the JBX

- Participants could not participate in governance

- Reserved list members could feel slighted

## Timeline

Multisig should execute the transaction to distribute 50k $JBX to each team that has completed the feedback form at the start of FC#28.

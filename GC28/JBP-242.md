## Thesis

Add Nicholas to the reserved list.

## Motivation

Nicholas has been contributing consistently for over a month and is on a recurring payout. This proposal seeks to add him to the reserved list via the _jb.daodevinc.eth_ wallet.

## Specification

Update reserved list on v1 and v2 JBDAO projects

## Risks

Slightly reduces reserve rate of other contributors, perhaps should reduce dao.jbx.eth allocation simultaneously to increase contributor compensation.

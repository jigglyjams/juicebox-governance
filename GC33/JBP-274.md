## Thesis:

Renew Nicholas’s payout (via _dao dev inc._) as a contributor on developer relations, product development, DAO operations, partnerships and communication ending in 7 FCs.

## Abstract:

Engage Nicholas (via an engagement with his company _dao dev inc._) to contribute to the following JuiceboxDAO initiatives: (1) Developer relations, (2) NFT strategy,  (3) DAO operations, (4) internal and external communications, (5) partnerships and recruiting for $8000 every FC. 

## Motivation:

Since my last payout proposal 7 cycles ago, I have:

Partnerships and recruiting

	- Was a guest on [Into The Bytecode](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy50cmFuc2lzdG9yLmZtL2ludG8tdGhlLWJ5dGVjb2Rl/episode/M2IxZTJmMDAtM2UwNC00MWE0LTlmYjUtMTI3ZDlmMDQ1NWFj?hl=en-CA&ved=2ahUKEwiqhLf87s76AhV2j2oFHRKNACsQieUEegQIFxAF&ep=6) and [TheDefiant](https://thedefiant.io/juicebox-supercharges-funding-guess-starring-metatope) with @Jango

Ancilliary Protocol Development

- NFT Auction project stub with @Viraz Malhotra 

During the proposed payout period, I intend to focus on

- Developing experiments and ancilliary Juicebox Projects in the vein of [tokenUriResolver](https://github.com/nnnnicholas/juice-tokenUriResolver), [Juicy Treasure](https://juicebox.money/@juicytreasure), [Banny Drawing Contest](https://www.jokedao.io/contest/polygon/0x5165B4a0b7A49601Ec588196B5c83D04E70E58B2/proposal/54631728254390848910948670171458370372955452113640658824175551952258405713378)

- DAO Operations: Audits, town hall, governance & discord varia

- Internal communications: help folks and opportunities meet optimally

- External communications: twitter, JBDAO 

- Partnerships and recruiting: project creator and developer relations to recruit talent to JBDAO and as 3rd parties to build atop the protocol.

**The one thing I didn’t do** was revise the terms of engagement, which I said I would do by now in my last proposal. I’m genuinely sorry about this — I should have done it but this renewal snuck up on. @filipv.eth is providing some feedback on improvements to my existing terms and I will be in touch with my company’s law firm this week to move forward on this. I’ll bring something to the DAO and hopefully get some feedback from folks in the DAO.

## Specification:

Retain the $8000 payout to jb.daodevinc.eth from FC33-FC40 inclusive. . This payout should be removed in FC33 unless renewed by proposal.

By voting to approve this proposal in Snapshot, you are confirming that you have read and agree to the [Terms of Engagement](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYpYs1uvRQ9thKsk8PVEekSzka6HtZ24SRVx2fzAgc94T) with _dao dev inc.,_ Nicholas’s employer.

_Terms of Engagement IPFS CID: QmYpYs1uvRQ9thKsk8PVEekSzka6HtZ24SRVx2fzAgc94T_

## Risks:

I do not perform meaningful work during this FC. 

I do not follow through with revised terms of engagement.

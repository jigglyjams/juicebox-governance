## Synopsis

Pay @Jango $22.5k reimbursement for his the Code4rena mitigation review security audit of Juicebox protocol v3. 

## Motivation

Jango paid 22.5k DAI to book a security audit with Code4rena. This is a mitigation review, in which C4A wardens will review the Juicebox V3 code, which patches the vulnerabilities discovered in [JBP-206 Sponsor Code4rena Audit](https://juicetool.xyz/snapshot/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x3bc54466f651d559b9e4ff45d1576085ec057fcb5bf6b85afacc5806b9c5a6f4). 

It is important that JBDAO fund a security audit of the V3 changes before they are deployed to mainnet. In the spirit of expedience, Jango fronted the money. If passed, this proposal would reimburse him for that expense. 

The contest is scheduled to begin on Tuesday September 13, 2022.

## Specification

- Add a $22.5k payout to dao.jbx.eth on the Juciebox V1 project. 

- Once distributed, the multisig should swap $22.5 worth of eth to DAI. 

- Then the multisig should transfer the DAI to jango.eth

## Rationale

This spec reimburses Jango correctly.

## Risks

Incorrect configuration. Audit doesnâ€™t take place. This is not a big risk because the start date of the contest is BEFORE voting closes on this proposal.

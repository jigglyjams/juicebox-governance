## Thesis

_What’s the idea?_

Renew the recurring payout of twodam.eth and move payout to v2 treasury project.

## Motivation

_Why now? What problems does this solve?_

Juicebox V2 is live on mainnet, it provides more functionality and possibility. There is need for <u>updating dune dashboards</u> to sync up with new features, for example: NFT Rewards, Treasury Extensions.

With the current process of preparing reconfiguration, it take hours/FC for me to review and submit the reconfiguration. There is need to <u>write tools and improve process</u>, so we can have more automatic system, reduce dependency on certain people (jango or me for now) to do this job. If we go further, we could automate bookkeeping too, make this a tool and provide to projects on juicebox protocol.

Juicebox have no official announcement channel for new features, although we do have regularly town-hall meetings and individuals who will tweet about features, there are still some people wondering the status of specific feature or questions like “what’s happening”. Why not make [a page for tracking all features](https://juicetool.xyz/progress), and even make a weekly newsletter if possible? (aggregating [0xSTVG’s weekly recap](https://twitter.com/0xSTVG/status/1553734201685422080?s=20&t=e1c06889Cro0EnzP00plgQ), [Zhape’s town-hall summary](https://twitter.com/zhape1112/status/1556085798176337920?s=20&t=gIkYqWPVd4lk6LsBZqRm_Q), [Matthew’s governance recap and podcast](https://twitter.com/0xmatthewb/status/1554495858581839874?s=20&t=e1c06889Cro0EnzP00plgQ) etc.)

## Specification

_How exactly will this be executed? Be specific and leave no ambiguity._

Pay 5000$ in ETH, from <u>**v2 treasury**</u> to the [TwodamLab](https://www.juicebox.money/@twodam) project (id: 115), every FC, for 6FC (ie: same action as in previous FC)

## Rationale

_Why is this specification the best way to address this thesis?_

### Things I am going to do

Automate and/or optimize routines, for example: reconfiguration, bookkeeping and multisig transaction validation.

Implement and aggregate data insights of juicebox, for example: DAO Health Analytics, status of ongoing development of projects/features and funded projects etc.

Fully integrate dune dashboards with v2 data, optimize the query for those timeouts due to growing data size.

Part of deliverable items:

- <u>Juicebox newsletter</u>, aggregate information from members (Jango, Aeolian, 0xSTVG, Zhape, Matthew), group them weekly/bi-weekly, serve as one-stop newsletter that people could subscribe (RSS Feed).

- <u>Juicebox v2 Project dashboard</u> on dune, including treasury, community token, NFT rewards and extensions.

- <u>Optimize the process of prepare and submit new reconfiguration</u>, starting from import bookkeeping CSV and generate reconfiguration transaction data, integrate with nance to fully automate this if feasible.

- <u>Optimize token balance tracker</u> on dune (timeout due to long execution time of queries).

- <u>Maintain docs and tools</u> on JuiceTool, including update feature progress, funded project and timeline etc.

- <u>Fully implement DAO Health Metrics</u> on JuiceTool (check demo [here](https://juicetool.xyz/metric))

### Things I’ve done

## Thesis:

Juicebox needs to continue making inroads into project-creator outreach through mixed media content. Felixander wants to continue in the role of building out Juicebox’s blog and embarking on architecting and populating Juicebox High, the juiciest repository of knowledge for prospective project creators. The DAO should renew Felixander’s payout with an added increase of $1000 per funding cycle, to reflect the greater commitment that Felixander has put into both the blog and marketing efforts in general, for a total of $3000 per funding cycle.

## Abstract:

Juicebox is in an excellent position to expand its messaging and to try to equip potential project creators with all tools necessary to create excellent projects. A major area of this expansion in messaging will center around Juicebox High, which will serve as the eventual home of the blog, project creation use-case scenarios, project-creation tooling explanations, tips and tricks, and archival material highlighting previous noteworthy projects. Juicebox is also in a unique position to establish a more clear and user-friendly onboarding flow by updating its project creation page and copy, and by linking out to various engaging resources. Felixander has been working in all of these efforts, and looks forward to continuing this work, for instance (examples below) by building out JB High with mixed media resources such as articles, videos, and infographics, among much more!

## Motivation:

This recurring payout renewal will allow Felixander to continue to work on these projects, and hopefully to have them complete in time for his next payout renewal in FC 34. A lot of the beginning work has been completed or is in progress, such as ideating the need for JB High, creating awesome infographics with the artistic help of Sage (thank you Sage!), establishing a need for smoother onboarding/project creation flow by reaching out to several core contributors. Now is the time to put a lot of the pieces together and build the thing. I want to build the thing.

## Risks:

I might just never do this work, or fuck off to Hawaii and sit on the beach side (you are all welcome to join if that happens!), or I may do the work badly. I hope you all have enough faith in me in this endeavor, but nothing is certain and that’s definitely a risk.

## Specification:

Extend Felixander’s payout for seven more funding cycles, expiring at FC#33. Increase Felixander’s payout to $3000 per funding cycle from the current $2000 per funding cycle.

## Rationale & examples of work:

I’ve been spearheading a lot of this, and so I feel like I’m in a great position to finish this work, and I also feel like it falls squarely into my areas of expertise. To be clear this is a team effort, and I can’t thank enough everyone who has helped me so far, but I have a vision for how JB High can work and what needs it can fill, and so far people seem to have been receptive to it, so I want to build that. In terms of the blog, my recent market-facing blog posts are continually dominated the blog traffic, and recent data on fathom suggests that those posts have had a positive SEO impact. So I think I am at least competent at the job, and looking forward to execute. I have added a higher payout and truth be told am self-conscious about this, since I know we are in a bear market. I am open to keeping my payout as it was, at $2000 per FC, if enough feel like that is more appropriate. The reason I am asking for an increase is that my role and commitment has increased significantly. For a recap of the work I’ve done and am doing, see below:


- Streamlining workflows - creating translation shared glossary to ensure that all our translated content meets professional criteria. I’ve been working on this with the translation team on and off for a while. [Document here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LUt1jDaeuWQMFeUJhnal7Ja_BE6PkiFHcA65u932IEk/edit?usp=sharing) The goal is that this would eventually be published on JB High as a resource for all translators of web3 content (whether they work with us or not).

- Creating infographics with Sage to help make engaging content around JB tooling. Examples [here](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/868159148544634880/994350885989777590), and [here](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/984526928516116580/985955145160458260) (also will post partial clip of this last one below!). The one we’re currently working on is on “Overflow”, so keep an eye out!

- Creating community building blog posts. JB in the Words Of etc. The most recent article on Mieos can be found [here](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-mieos). The next interview to drop will be Mr. Goldstein, and that will be published next week!

- Creating market-facing JB tooling explainers, JB platform explainers, and articles designed to increase SEO and engagement on the JB website. Examples of articles can be found [here](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/the-power-of-token-minting-explained) (this was the first of a 5-article series, with more to come!). Regarding SEO, here is the last 30 days of activity. You can see that the blog posts are doing well. SEO is a crawl, not a sprint, but these numbers are encouraging.

	- My articles were published July 2nd. For image 2, in the last 30 days, the two market-facing articles have been the most-trafficked. Numbers are very small but encouraging.

## Timeline:

This is a recurring payout renewal so it will renew my payouts at a new amount.

## Gratitude:

This is my first payout renewal request, and I want to take a moment and thank you all for welcoming me into the community, and for being patient with many n00b questions that I had. Tank you so much tankbottoms for sponsoring! Particularly want to thank filipv, who onboarded me onto JB, and has been a mentor through and through. And also huge shout out to Wagmi, which was my first real web3 family. Love you guys!

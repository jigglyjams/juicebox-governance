## Thesis

Set the handle of the V2 Juicebox project to `@juicebox`

## Motivation

This will make the V2 Juicebox project searchable, and allow sharing it via a clean URL (juicebox.money/#/@juicebox)

## Specification

This will require two transactions costing only gas, that can be sent via the [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) UI.

- set handle ENS name to juicebox.eth

- set ENS text record on juicebox.eth `juicebox_project_id=1`

## Rationale

This is the only way to set a handle for the Juicebox V2 project

## Risks

- Folks get confused by having two juicebox projects with the handle `@juicebox` (v1 and v2 juicebox projects)

## Timeline

These transactions can be sent as soon as this proposal is passed. No funding cycle-related requirements.

## Thesis

Extend registration of jbx.eth and jbox.eth ENS names by 3 years for 2.121 ETH.
_Note: The cost of extending jbx.eth is 1.697 ETH (higher due to being a 3-letter ENS name), while the cost to extend jbox.eth is only 0.424 ETH._

## Motivation

jbx.eth is an important asset for the DAO (the multisig’s ens name is dao.jbx.eth) and, although I don’t think we’ve used it for anything, jbox.eth is cool too. jbx.eth is currently in grace period until Sept 29. jbox.eth expires on July 12.

## Specification

Both ENS names can be extended in a single transaction via app.ens.domains, which can be executed by the multisig via the ENS gnosis app.

## Rationale

This is the only option for retaining ownership of these ENS names.

## Risks

One or both of these ENS names could become worthless to the DAO, and our investment in renewing their registration would go to 0.

## Timeline

If it passes, the proposal can be executed immediately by the multisig provided it has an adequate ETH balance. Otherwise a payout to the multisig will need to be created during the next upcoming funding cycle.

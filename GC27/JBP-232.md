## Thesis:

Proposal from Viraz to renew his recurring payment for $4000 per Funding Cycle

## Abstract:

I have been working part-time on the protocol side of things, since before my first recurring payment proposal [Recurring Payment Proposal for Viraz](https://www.notion.so/80cb5a65a0a64cc3904759440a52dc87)  & would like to continue that going forward.

## Motivation:

Since my last recurring payment proposal [Recurring Payment Proposal for Viraz](https://www.notion.so/80cb5a65a0a64cc3904759440a52dc87) here is the work I have done in chronological order:

- Added Support in Banny Staking Contract to handle multiple unlocks along with forge tests ([Commit](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/jbx-staking/commit/35c7a6e747752fd4cef855999f7c49e5ba9dec9f)) & ([Commit](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/jbx-staking/commit/d8ff93b14fa07d87aed7323f1f024646c5497b83))

- Fixed up Banny Contract with various missing assertion checks ([Commit](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/jbx-staking/commit/fc0e84257d7bc40d96e6a028de806fbdccaabaf8))

- Worked on veBanny PR with [0xBA5ED](https://www.notion.so/4f50b0a2c585420ea3b4a373b152dad2) ([PR](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/jbx-staking/pull/16))

- Improved veBanny with [0xBA5ED](https://www.notion.so/4f50b0a2c585420ea3b4a373b152dad2) in terms of gas optimizations ([List of Commits](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/jbx-staking/commits/master?before=ab32bb0d17e24199f63613babe0066460b149e2e+105&branch=master&qualified_name=refs%2Fheads%2Fmaster))

- Add more test scenarios & Improve the Test Suite for veBanny 

- Add Fuzz Tests for veBanny ([List Of Commits in the bottom](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/jbx-staking/commits/master?before=ab32bb0d17e24199f63613babe0066460b149e2e+70&branch=master&qualified_name=refs%2Fheads%2Fmaster))

- Add Voting power calculation in veBanny Tests ([Last Relevant Commit](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/jbx-staking/commit/0210847f2b79be37669dcf3eb29e3cf32d4508d2))

- Github Action Integration in veBanny ([PR](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/jbx-staking/pull/19))

- Forge Deployment Script for veBanny & Tests for deployer contract ([PR](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/jbx-staking/pull/20))

- Missing veBanny test scenarios & Minor Gas Golfing ([PR](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/jbx-staking/pull/21))

- More Missing Tests to improve test coverage ([PR](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/jbx-staking/pull/22))

- PR review for NFT Reward Contracts ([PR](https://github.com/cptspacecadet/juice-contracts-v2/pull/3#issuecomment-1159651964))

- Worked with @nicholas on banana auction machine as a collab between BuidlGuild & JuiceBox ([PR1](https://github.com/austintgriffith/banana-auction/pull/2)) ([PR2](https://github.com/austintgriffith/banana-auction/pull/4)) & some more minor changes in the repo

**Previous work (in the last Recurring Proposal)**:

- Implemented Custom Errors in V2 ([PR](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/31))

- [Ad](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/236)ded Forge Tests & Initial Template for JBX Banny ([PR](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/jbx-staking/pull/10))

The veBanny stuff is probably at the end stages of its development cycle we need more eyes from other contributors working on the protocol side of things and decide the next steps.

## Risks:

- Code quality isn’t up to the mark

- Unable to deliver according to the timelines

- Viraz could go AWOL

## Specification:

For the next 6 funding cycles renew Viraz’s (viraz.eth) recurring payouts for $4000 per funding cycle in the JuiceBox DAO.

## Rationale:

Since I started contributing to JuiceBox earlier this year my aim only has been to learn as much as I can & make contributions that can have a positive impact on the DAO, my previous recurring payout amount was $3000 per funding cycle, so during the beginning of FC 26 I had a healthy discussion with a couple of experienced protocol devs, regarding my performance feedback to identify what can I improve going forward, and I came to the conclusion that I am ready to take more responsibility going forward, contribute more on the protocol side of things and be more active in the DAO so hence with this renewal proposal I have increased my payout amount to $4000 per funding cycle.

## Timeline:

Enter Recurring Payouts starting at FC 27 for next 6 funding cycles until FC 33.

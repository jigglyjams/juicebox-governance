Juicebox needs to explore content creation strategies in order to improve visibility, attract new project creators, and drive protocol growth. We are proposing to achieve this through accessible, entertaining, and educational case studies of successful and emerging projects being built on Juicebox. By leveraging the network effect of JB projects and their communities, we can help spread the _juicy_ word and achieve wider adoption.

We both have experience producing web3 native content for DAOs including podcasts, interviews, articles, blog posts, and Twitter Spaces. Our contributions have helped build brand awareness, community, and engagement through the production of high-quality, fresh content that doesn’t feel too corporate. We have been committed members of the Juicebox ecosystem since March and would like to become dedicated contributors in this fruity menagerie.

## **Abstract:**

While Juicebox is dedicating most of its resources to development, we also need to find ways to reach new users and increase project creation. One of the most difficult challenges facing Juicebox is mental models: what is Juicebox and how do we explain it to users who aren’t already familiar? One of the ways that we can approach this problem is through case studies of existing JB projects, which works both to promote use cases of the protocol and support projects currently being built on top of it.

We are proposing a recurring payout to contribute to storytelling, education, and improving Juicebox’s visibility through a series of podcasts and articles. Together, these materials will spread more awareness about JB projects, inspire new project creation through the success of past projects, and help explain how JB works to newcomers with concrete examples and use cases.

## **Motivation:**

Over the last few months, we have consistently produced content about Juicebox and contributed to discussions about growing the protocol’s visibility. Balancing JB’s headless brand approach with the need for a solid marketing strategy is challenging and we feel a sense of urgency to increase the intensity of our output to help drive protocol growth. 

We would like to direct our attention fully towards JB as dedicated contributors carrying increased responsibility within the DAO. To reflect this increased intensity and commitment, JBDAO should recognize these efforts with a recurring payout that will allow us to devote the time needed to carry out the proposed _delicious_ deliverables.

## Recent Work:

🎙 [The Juicecast](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast) is a cultural anthropology of Juicebox featuring interviews with community members building and maintaining projects using the protocol. We are responsible for all production tasks from interview prep, scheduling guests, co-hosting, editing, audio engineering, and Twitter campaigns. We have taken a portion of our payouts and invested in more audio equipment—additional microphones, audio software, acoustic treatment—to ensure that our productions are very high quality.

Here are the podcasts that we have already published:

🏗 [Lexicon Devils and metaverse architecture](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast/episodes/Ep--8-Peacenode-and-Wackozacco-from-Lexicon-Devils-e1l3k94/a-a884kvo)

✍🏻 In addition to the [Juicecast](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast), we have contributed to the JB blog by writing about projects as case studies of what can be successfully built on Juicebox. Our goal with these articles is to increase the searchability and visibility of projects in order to help them succeed, and to educate readers about what Juicebox makes possible.

Written content that we have published on the Juicebox blog:

🏗 [Lexicon Devils: A metaverse Architecture Guild](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/2022-07-14-lexicon-devils)

🦈 [SharkDAO: A Sub-DAO Raising Funds to Participate in the Nouns Ecosystem](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/2022-07-18-sharkdao)

In addition to our role as content creators, we have made an effort to contribute to Juicebox in other ways. Miscellaneous tasks so far have included:

🏦 Maintaining the [Ongoing Contributor Payouts](/c51c3d59c21445988f17c9332b7163dc?v=5c457b4e49f84dceb3fca8b10aa66132) table on Notion

🥈 A worthy competitor to Zom_Bae in the gm channel

## Future work:

🎙️ We’ll continue producing the [Juicecast ](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast)as a storytelling vehicle for projects and communities built on the protocol. Going forward, we would also like to cross-post this content to YouTube/Vimeo to better optimize searchability and increase the reach of projects as well as the podcast itself. Here are a few podcast episodes that we have in the pipeline:

🧃 Reflections on 1 year of the Juicebox protocol with Jango, Peri, and early contributors

🃏 Bottom-up, on-chain governance with JokeDAO

📜 A retrospective 2-part deep dive on ConstitutionDAO

🍊 The frontend wizards of Peel managing a DAOified product team on Juicebox

✍🏻 Alongside the [Juicecast](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast), we’ll continue writing long-form content that uplifts JB projects, leverages their communities to spread the JB meme, and demonstrates clear use cases for the protocol. Here are a few articles that we have in the pipeline:

🚀 How MoonDAO is decentralizing space exploration and research through Juicebox

🎨 TileDAO: a community-owned NFT project built on Juicebox

📜 A ConstitutionDAO post-mortem: the story behind raising $42M on Juicebox

## **Risks:**

- Not producing enough content to justify the increased payout amount

- Recurring payouts should be weighed seriously given market conditions

## **Specification:**

Add $1500 USD recurring payout from [FC#27](https://www.notion.so/cc27c26909ce4f608aa73b20c8e41c00) to [FC#33](https://www.notion.so/dac5c02da79c490b8078ccc24261fcd0) to matthewbrooks.eth

Add $1500 USD recurring payout from [FC#27](https://www.notion.so/cc27c26909ce4f608aa73b20c8e41c00) to [FC#33](https://www.notion.so/dac5c02da79c490b8078ccc24261fcd0) to brileigh.eth

## **Rationale:**

Our previous trial payouts were $1000 USD each for [matthewbrooks.eth](https://www.notion.so/f2e36c73f12a4fddaceb4bcb35c6c9ff) and [brileigh.eth](https://www.notion.so/082e9b5acc1c457d9f379f8815505e1c) per FC for all podcast related production tasks. To recognize our increased output, we are requesting $1500 USD each per FC to allow us to devote the time needed to JB. This rate is taking into account current market conditions while also reflecting our added workload. 

We are confident that we can bring long-term value to the JB ecosystem as dedicated contributors building a storytelling machine that 🍌 ap-peels 🍌 to new project creators, increases visibility, and builds stronger community.

## **Timeline:**

This proposal will take effect from [FC#27](https://www.notion.so/cc27c26909ce4f608aa73b20c8e41c00) to [FC#33](https://www.notion.so/dac5c02da79c490b8078ccc24261fcd0).

Throughout and especially towards the end of this recurring payout, we will look back honestly at what has worked, what hasn’t, and determine the direction that will be most beneficial to JB going forward.

## Thesis

Reduce Juicebox DAO’s discount rate to 0.5%.

## Motivation

JBX issuance has been significantly reduced over time by the discount rate. Because of this, less JBX is going to project creators, contributors, and the DAO.

## Specification

- Configure [JuiceboxDAO v1](https://juicebox.money/p/juicebox)’s discount rate to `5` (a discount rate of 0.5%).

- Configure v2 [JuiceboxDAO](https://juicebox.money/@juicebox)’s discount rate to `5000000` (a discount rate of 0.5%).

## Risks

The discount rate rewards earlier JBX recipients. Reducing the discount rate reduces this reward.

## Timeline

The discount rate should remain at 0.5% until this proposal is revoked or superceded by another proposal.

## Thesis

Add jmill to the reserved list, tokens sent to `jmill.eth`.

## Motivation

jmill has been contributing fulltime to Juicebox via Peel for several months now and is on recurring payout. Additionally, he plans to create projects which use Juicebox Protocol and Platform in novel ways in the coming months.

## Specification

Update the reserved list on v1 and v2 JBDAO projects as follows:

- 30% to dao.jbx.eth

- 70% evenly split between all current reserved token recipients (except for dao.jbx.eth) and jmill.

## Risks

Slightly reduces reserve rate of other contributors. jmill does not follow through on creating novel platform uses.

## Timeline

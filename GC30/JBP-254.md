## Thesis

Remove translation payouts.

## Motivation

- Nothing has been translated for over a month.

- Nothing translated on DeWork has ever been publicly distributed (except for documents distributed by Zhape and Twodam).

- Countries reflected in [juicebox.money analytics](https://app.usefathom.com/share/eryrrjsv/juicebox.money) do not necessarily reflect the Juicebox community. Hong Kong, India, Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore contain major VPN servers used by popular providers.

- Zhape, Twodam, and other contributors are independently translating [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money/) and other important documents into Chinese. This system is preferred, as those contributors produce high-quality translations and can exercise reasonable discretion.

## Specification

Revoke _JBP-183 - Zótico’s reccuring payout update_. Remove all payouts to `0x6212ce06Dcac01706e6Be5310C3228ede1A02ADf`.

Remove any outstanding translation budgets.

## Risks

- This proposal will probably be controversial.

- [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money/) will not be as inclusive.

- Having translations on hand would be very useful in the case of a major publicity event within a country which speaks one of the languages mentioned above.

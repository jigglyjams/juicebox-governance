## Thesis

Add gnance.eth (0x50e70c43a5DD812e2309eAcea61348041011b4BA) as a delegate to the Juicebox gnosis-safe (0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e). This will allow nance to automatically queue transaction to the multi-sig. No abilities to execute the transactions will be held by gnance.eth.

## Motivation

We want to make things easier for the multi-sig signers. Every funding cycle twodam must manually enter any new payouts and reserve rate distributions into the project reconfiguration. This can be a tedious task and automating it will free up additional time of important contributors.

## Specification

There is not an official app to add delegates to a safe (gnosis only provides an API endpoint for it). There is however an open source project that implements one, [https://gnosis-delegator-soptq.vercel.app/](https://gnosis-delegator-soptq.vercel.app/), with source code, [https://github.com/Soptq/gnosis-safe-delegate-dapp](https://github.com/Soptq/gnosis-safe-delegate-dapp).

**Major Note: the app only supports MetaMask at the moment**

If approved, one of the multi-sig signers will need to follow the following steps:

- Go to [https://gnosis-delegator-soptq.vercel.app/](https://gnosis-delegator-soptq.vercel.app/)

- Connect MetaMask wallet

- Load Gnosis Safes

- Add 0x50e70c43a5DD812e2309eAcea61348041011b4BA, label ‘nance’

- Sign transaction

- Done!

## Rationale

See motivation.

More information on multi-sig delegates here: [https://safe-docs.dev.gnosisdev.com/safe/docs/tutorial_tx_service_set_delegate/](https://safe-docs.dev.gnosisdev.com/safe/docs/tutorial_tx_service_set_delegate/)

## Risks

Signers may not have MetaMask making this proposal a little harder to implement. If that is the case, jigglyjams will submit a PR to the project to add more wallet support.

## Timeline

To be implement before FC#31 begins so that nance can automatically submit transactions for FC#31

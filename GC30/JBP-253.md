## Thesis

Renew the recurring payout for 0xBA5ED for 6 funding cycles.

## Abstract

I have been working full-time writing, modifying, checking and testing smart-contracts for Juicebox V2 and V2 extensions. My initial recurring payment has come to an end, this proposal will allow me to keep working full-time on Juicebox.

## Motivation

I have worked on a large variety of things since my last proposal, here is a small list of the most important things:

- Work on NFT-Rewards ([commits](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-rewards/commits?author=xBA5ED))

- Work on VeBanny ([commits](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-ve-nft/commits?author=xBA5ED))

- Work on AppleJuice ([commits](https://github.com/drgorillamd/applejuice-terminal/commits/feat/AJPayoutRedemptionTerminal?author=xBA5ED))

- Work on on-chain governance ([repo](https://github.com/xBA5ED/juice-kickstart-governance))

- Started writing formal verification for V2 ([commit](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/commit/886eb82ce60095adfa65d68a00684cb3cb1d6a02))

During EthCC I took a course by [Certora](https://www.certora.com/) on how to do formal verification. The normal cost for having contracts formally verified is $70,000 per week ([source](https://governance.aave.com/t/continuous-formal-verification/6308#pricing-12)). However I am now able to work on this for Juicebox, potentially saving a large amount of money.

In the future FC's I would like to work on:

- Finishing the WIP extensions

- [Standardising extensions](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/1009283720273989762/1009283721775546470)

- More extensions (gasless payments, llamapay integration)

- L2/Side-chain versions(/extensions) of Juicebox

- Formal verification of more Juicebox contracts

## Specification

For the next 6 funding cycles continue to pay (0xBA5ED) `0xb045708e396E20071324C1aed2E4CFB90A0764FE` $8000 per funding cycle and keep him on the list of beneficiaries of reserved JBX.

## Rationale

Smart-contract developers are hard to hire because its new, niche and there is a high demand. 0xBA5ED is an experienced smart-contract developer and is comfortable with and has a good understanding of the Juicebox V2 codebase.

## Risks

- Reduced quality or less code shipped than before

- 0xBA5ED could stop contributing

## Timeline

Renew recurring payouts starting at funding cycle 30 for 6 funding cycles.

# JBP-281 - Renew and Increase Recurring Payout for Matthew and Brileigh
## Synopsis

Renew and increase Matthew and Brileigh’s recurring payout to continue producing high quality content including The Juicecast, Juicenews, articles on the JB blog, and YouTube videos.

## Motivation

Juicebox needs to continue developing content creation strategies in order to improve visibility, attract new project creators, and drive protocol growth. The best way to achieve this is through informative storytelling centered around projects being built on Juicebox, leveraging the network effect of successful JB projects while educating and inspiring new project creators.

We are a DAO content duo with experience producing web3 native content for orgs such as RAW DAO, JuiceboxDAO, and NounsDAO. Our contributions have helped build brand awareness, community, and engagement through fresh, original content that doesn’t feel too corporate. Matthew’s precision and attention to detail is balanced out by Brileigh’s speed and energy, allowing them to work together to hold each other accountable and keep the juice flowing.

### Recent work

🎙 [The Juicecast](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast) is a cultural anthropology of Juicebox featuring interviews with community members building and maintaining projects using the protocol. We are responsible for all production tasks from interview prep, scheduling guests, co-hosting, editing, audio engineering, and Twitter campaigns.

Here are the episodes that we have recently published:

📜 Five guests (so far) for the ConstitutionDAO deep dive multi-part retrospective podcast

We’ve started cross-posting podcast content as custom 4k waveform visualizers to [JBDAO YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/c/JuiceboxDAO)for better visibility and searchability, helping us to better leverage the network effect of guests who appear on the podcast:

We’ve also recently started embedding chapter metadata into episodes to help listeners navigate to timestamps more easily in supported applications (e.g. Apple Podcasts, Overcast).

In addition to the audio Juicecast, we have recently started recording video interviews with high-profile guests to help bring new audiences into the Juicebox ecosystem:

✍🏻 In addition to the [Juicecast](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast), we have contributed to the [JB blog](https://info.juicebox.money/blog) by writing about projects as case studies of what can be successfully built on Juicebox. These articles have been paired with configuration how-to articles to give new project creators a concise breakdown of how past projects were configured and inspire them to create projects with similar structures. Our goal with these articles is also to give project creators space to talk about their work while helping them achieve better visibility.

### Upcoming work

🎙️ We’ll continue co-hosting and producing [The Juicecast](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast) as a storytelling vehicle for projects and communities built on the protocol. Here are a few episodes that we have in the pipeline:

📜 A retrospective deep dive series on ConstitutionDAO (3+ episodes)

✍🏻 Alongside [The Juicecast](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast), we’ll continue writing long-form content on the [JB blog](https://info.juicebox.money/blog) that uplifts projects, leverages their communities to spread the JB meme, and demonstrates clear use cases for the protocol. Here are a few articles that we have in the pipeline:

📜 A ConstitutionDAO post-mortem: the story behind raising $42M on Juicebox + config article

🎨 TileDAO: a community-owned NFT project built on Juicebox + config article

🗞️ We’ll continue editing and publishing a weekly edition of [Juicenews](https://juicenews.beehiiv.com/), web3’s juiciest newsletter jam-packed with recent podcast and blog articles, video tutorials, governance recaps, protocol updates, and town hall summaries.

## Specification

Add $3000 USD recurring payout from FC#34 to FC#40 to matthewbrooks.eth from the v2 treasury

Add $3000 USD recurring payout from FC#34 to FC#40 to brileigh.eth from the v2 treasury

Once v3 is live on mainnet, Brileigh and Matthew will create a JB project and inform the bookkeeper to transfer this payout to the project instead of the addresses listed above.

## Rationale**:**

We are proposing an increased recurring payout to reflect the added workload and output that has emerged over the last seven funding cycles. Since the start of our previous recurring payout, we have built up a comprehensive content strategy and are asking for JBDAO’s support to continue bringing greater visibility to the Juicebox ecosystem. 

## **Timeline:**

This proposal should take effect immediately, starting in FC#34 and ending in FC#40.

## Thesis:

Proposal from Viraz to renew his recurring payment for $4000 per Funding Cycle

## Abstract:

I have been working part-time on the protocol side of things, and have contributed over more than 12 funding cycles  and so I would like to continue the same and keep contributing towards the protocol side of things details of my previous proposals here

## Motivation:

Since my[ last recurring payment proposal](/38f2e6cab592453c94691954ca54fa14), here is the work I have done in chronological order:

- Resumed work on the apple juice’s erc4626 vault branch   ([Commits](https://github.com/drgorillamd/applejuice-terminal/commits/feat/AJPayoutRedemptionTerminal))

- Researched/Worked on testing yield strategies with hackable erc4626 vaults ([PR](https://github.com/xBA5ED/MockERC4626/pull/1)) 

- Worked on fixing up vault accounting in apple juice (ongoing pr with only test coverage left) ([PR](https://github.com/drgorillamd/applejuice-terminal/pull/4))

- Worked on the initial version of Juice-Auction ([Commits](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-auction/commits?author=viraj124))

- Worked on adding redemption feature in juice auction (ongoing pr) ([PR](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-auction/pull/4))

- Research on using a Merkel root approach for Defifia ([PR](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-defifa/pull/1))

- Add remaining tests & cleaning up the governer contract (ongoing pr) ([PR](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-defifa/pull/3))

- Gas Golfing updates to c4a audit fund NFT ([PR](https://github.com/nnnnicholas/auditfund-nftdrop/pull/1))

- Working on configuring funding cycles for Defifa ([Ongoing PR](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-defifa/pull/4))

## Risks:

- Code quality isn’t up to the mark

- Unable to deliver according to the timelines

- Viraz could go AWOL

## Specification:

For the next 7 funding cycles renew Viraz’s (`0x2dda8dc2f67f1eb94b250caefac9de16f70c5a51`) recurring payouts for $4000 per funding cycle in the JuiceBox DAO.

## Rationale:

It’s been an amazing experience, especially from a skill point of view to be able to contribute don't the protocol side of things.

I asked for feedback from senior protocol devs during renewing my proposal for the 1st time I think I have implemented that in my work approach and I have gotten better in terms of my skills & I want to continue to contribute on the protocol side of things and try to make a positive impact on the DAO.

Going forward, the general plan is getting defifa, veBanny out, resume on other projects like apple juice and juice auction depending on priorities, and/or continue helping on the protocol side of things for any other stuff depending on priority.

## Timeline:

Enter Recurring Payouts starting at FC 34 for the next 7 funding cycles until FC 40.

## Synopsis

Renew recurring payout to twodam at 5000$ per cycle for 7 cycles.

## Motivation

Automate the process, visualize the data and build tools around the ecosystems.

## Specification

Pay 5000$ in ETH, from v2 treasury to the TwodamLab project (id: 115), every FC, for 7FC (ie: same action as in previous FC)

## Rationale

### Things I am going to do:

- Nance Interface, work together with @jigglyjams to automate the process of reconfiguration, bookkeeping and progress notification.

- Dune Dashboards, update with v1&v2&v3 data, maintain views which group the data of all projects by version.

- Snapshot Plus, query snapshot data from [Flipside Crypto](https://flipsidecrypto.github.io/ethereum-models/#!/model/model.ethereum_models.core__ez_snapshot#details) and construct dashboards by space. (example like [Snapshot Mega Dashboard](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/dashboard/HTKJ44) and [Snapshot Doddle Dashboard](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/dashboard/_wqamM))

- [Juicebox Center](https://juicetool.xyz/center), make it more complete and interactive.

### Things I've done:

- [Snapshot Plus](https://juicetool.xyz/snapshot/jbdao.eth), voting with search, filter and more stats.

- [Nance Interface](https://juicetool.xyz/nance/juicebox), display proposals by GC and submit proposals with typed data, such as Payout Address, Amount and Cycles.

- [Transaction Diff](https://juicetool.xyz/diff), visualize the diff of two transactions, support load transactions from Safe API directly.

- [Juicebox Reconfiguration Compare](https://juicetool.xyz/juicebox), compare v1 reconfigurations more easily.

- [Random Juicebox Project](https://juicetool.xyz/lucky), roll dice and get one random Juicebox Project.

- [Proofread the Chinese transaction on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/juicebox-interface/reports/top-members)

- Review the bookkeeping files and schedule the transactions for Multisig members.

## Timeline

Take effect through reconfiguration of FC#34, end on FC#40
